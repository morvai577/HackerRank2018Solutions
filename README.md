## Algorithms Challenges

### Challenge 1
The function named solveMeFirst takes two integers (x, y) and computes their sum

### Challenge 2
The function named solve takes two lines of strings and returns an array of two integers denoting the respective comparison points earned by a and b.

### Challenge 3
The function named aVeryBigSum takes an array of integers and returns the sum of the array.

### Challenge 4
The function named diagonalDifference takes a matrix and computes the diagonal difference of the values inside the matrix.

### Challenge 5
The function named plusMinus takes an array and prints the following three lines: (1) A decimal representing of the fraction of positive numbers in the array compared to its size. (2) A decimal representing of the fraction of negative numbers in the array compared to its size. (3) A decimal representing of the fraction of zeros in the array compared to its size.

### Challenge 6
The function staircase takes an integer n and prints a staircase that is right-aligned, composed of # symbols and spaces, and has a height and width of n.

### Challenge 7
The function miniMaxSum takes five positive integers, finds the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then prints the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

### Challenge 8
The function birthdayCakeCandles takes two input lines: The first line contains a single integer, denoting the number of candles on the cake. The second line contains n space-separated integers, where each integer i describes the height of candle i. The function outputs the number of candles that can be blown out (the tallest candle in terms of height) on a new line.
